## What's that?
It's a piece of software made with Node.JS that I made, because I wanted to have a simple way of managing **Minecraft SMP Sessions** with my friends. With that in mind I've started to make a dashboard, with features I considered handy.

## Features
Keep in mind that the software is in early stages of development and more things will be added, or changed.
- Integrated console
- Player list and count via aquiring game query.
- Server properties editor powered by **CodeMirror**
- Memory and CPU Usage monitoring.
- Mod and plugins management.
- Scheduler, that allows creating tasks at specified day and time. (Messages, executing commands, restarting the server, and doing a backup)
- Integrated FTP Server
- Command Macros, which allow you to execute multiple commands one after another with a click of a button.
